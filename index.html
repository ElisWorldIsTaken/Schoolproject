<h1> Thesis statement </h1>
<p>..Thesis Statement: With ChatGPT being on the rise and it having seemingly infinite possibilities. we wanted to see if ai can simulate a society. If so, what are its limits and capabilities? 
                                                                                </p>

  
  <h1>Limitations in research</h1>
  <p>Flaws and Limitations In our research and testing
----------------------------------------------------------------
Not many people have tried the experiment that were trying. So it was harder to find any sources than it should've been.
Speaking of sources, It was even harder to find credible sources.
Limitation: Chatgpt gets confused easily, So it sometimes refuses to do things even when it's explained. To get around this, I tried to make my own AI chatbot but I was unable to due to my having to have an API Key….which is paid. So with me unable to make my chatbot train, I was forced to the limitations of the chatbot.
Chatgpt has a limit of messages per hour, So I can only say so many things at once.

  <h1>Summary of research</h1>
  <p>Our thesis statement is that if AI can simulate a society. If so, what are its limits and capabilities? We already had a few limitations like having a limit of words to write and not having any credible sources. On our first attempt everything was going fine when we realized that ChatGPT didn’t countdown time correctly it went up instead of going down. Because this happened we decided to make our own AI but we needed to pay. When we fixed it giving it a new script, it worked perfectly when we used our command words like “Advance”, “Event”, “Age”, And “Stats”.This Proves our thesis statement that AI can simulate a society.</p>
