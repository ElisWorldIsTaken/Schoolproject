<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/heres-what-happened-when-stanford-created-a-virtual-world-full-of-chatgpt-powered-peoplem"> A group of AI researchers from Stanford and Google research created a simulation featuring 25 characters powered by ChatGPT.
The simulation ran for two days and illustrated that AI-powered bots could interact in a human-like way.
The bots planned a party, coordinated the event, and attended the party within the simulation.
"In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior," reads the summary.

<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2369740-chatgpt-agents-are-better-at-simulated-role-play-than-humans/"> AI agents powered by ChatGPT showed human-like planning and behavior in simulations, demonstrating social behavior such as organizing a Valentine's Day party. “This idea of creating believable agents that exhibit this behavior – that give the illusion of realism – was something that we as an academic field wanted and have been talking about for the last four decades,” says Joon Sung Park at Stanford University in California.

<a href="https://clp.law.harvard.edu/article/the-implications-of-chatgpt-for-legal-services-and-society/"> To be clear, the responses generated by ChatGPT were imperfect and at times problematic, and the use of an AI tool for law-related services raises a host of regulatory and ethical issues. At the same time, ChatGPT highlights the promise of artificial intelligence, including its ability to affect our lives in both modest and more profound ways. ChatGPT suggests an imminent reimagination of how we access and create information, obtain legal and other services, and prepare people for their careers. We also will soon face new questions about the role of knowledge workers in society, the attribution of work (e.g., determining when people’s written work is their own), and the potential misuse of and excessive reliance on the information produced by these kinds of tools. The disruptions from AI’s rapid development are no longer in the distant future. They have arrived, and this document offers a small taste of what lies ahead..</a> 
<a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/ibm-to-pause-hiring-for-jobs-replaceable-by-ai.aspx"> IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said the company expects to pause hiring for roles that could be replaced by artificial intelligence in the coming years, marking one of the most disruptive workplace responses to the rapidly advancing technology. Most talent acquisition professionals who use artificial intelligence and automation technology say it improves time-to-fill, but they still have some uncertainty about whether the tools protect against bias..</a>

<a href="https://hackernoon.com/exploring-the-potential-of-generative-agents-simulating-human-behavior-with-ai"> Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications. In this work, researchers at Google and Stanford demonstrate generative agents by populating a sandbox environment, reminiscent of The Sims, with twenty-five agents. Users can observe and intervene as agents they plan their days, share news, form relationships, and coordinate group activities.</a>
